Browsers
========

This website has been tested in the following browsers as working or not working.

Fully Supported Browsers:
-------------------------
This means I actively test with these browsers:

* Chrome 16
* Firefox 8-10 (most users on these auto-updated versions)
* Firefox 3.6 (still many users on this older standard)
* IE9 (because IE10 = awesome but might be on Window 8 only)
* IE8 (because all XP users cannot upgrade to IE9)
* Safari 5.1
* Opera 11.62


Support in Progress:
--------------------
This means I am testing with these beta version or very newly released browsers:

* Chrome 17 Beta
* Firefox 11 Beta
* IE 10 (when the beta is made available for Win7 users)
* Opera Next (12.00a)


Partially Supported Browsers:
-----------------------------
This means I will fix a reported issue and occaisonally test with these older, but still in use browsers:

* Safari 5
* Opera 11.10
* Opera 11.50
* Opera 11.52 (but, MP4 Video opens in Quicktime plugin...)
* IE7 (See below also; I'm wavering...)
* Chrome 6-15 (almost no one uses them because of Google's auto-update)


Unsupported Browsers
--------------------
This means that the website may or may not work in the following browsers, but I will not correct problems with them, since they are outdated and usage statistics show no one uses them anymore:

* IE6 (officially delisted by Microsoft)
* IE7 (has issues with JWPlayer 5.8+; users can freely upgrade to IE8)
* Chrome 1-5
* Firefox 1-3.5
* Safari 4
* Opera 9-10.x
